        <p class="text">Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker, a teenage high school student and an orphan 
            raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in
             a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial
              issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn;
               romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as the Green Goblin,
                Doctor Octopus, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and abilities 
                after being bitten by a radioactive spider; these include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability,
                 coordination, and balance, clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider, and detecting danger with his
                  precognition ability called "spider-sense". <br> He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial
                   spider-webs of his own design, which are used both for fighting and for web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker
                    originally used his powers for his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that
             Peter did not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime by becoming the superhero known as Spider-Man.

                    Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name,
                     created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp,
                      it is the first installment in Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, produced by Columbia Pictures in 
                      association with Marvel Enterprises and Laura Ziskin Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. <br><br>
                       The film stars Tobey Maguire as the titular character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, 
                       Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origin story and early superhero career. 
                       After being bitten by a genetically altered spider, outcast teenager Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman 
                       abilities and adopts a masked superhero identity to
                     fight crime and injustice in New York City, facing the sinister Green Goblin in the process.

                     Development on a live-action Spider-Man film began in 1975. Filmmakers Tobe Hooper,
                      James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct the film at one point. However,
                       the project would languish in development hell due to licensing and financial issues. After
                        progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release
                         by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) on all 
                         previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco, and New Cannon. Exercising its option on 
                         just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James
                          Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen, and Joseph Goldman), Sony hired Koepp
                      to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in final billing.

                    The Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man and
                     sharing the title of the character's longest-running comic book series. Produced by Columbia Pictures in
                      association with Marvel Entertainment, Laura Ziskin Productions, Arad Productions, Inc., and Matt Tolmach 
                      Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the fourth theatrical Spider-Man film, serving 
                      as a reboot of the series following Sam Raimi's 2002â€“2007 Spider-Man trilogy, and the first of the two The Amazing
                       Spider-Man films. <br><br> The film was directed by Marc Webb and written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve 
                       Kloves, based on a story by Vanderbilt, and stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside
                        Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell Scott, Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field. In the
                         film, Peter Parker grapples with both high school and super-human crisis as his alter-ego Spider-Man.
                        Development of the film began following the cancellation of Spider-Man 4 in January 2010, ending director Sam Raimi's
                        Spider-Man film series that originally featured Tobey Maguire as the titular superhero. <br><br>
                         Columbia Pictures opted to reboot the franchise with the same production team along with 
                         Vanderbilt to stay on with writing the next Spider-Man film, while Sargent and Kloves helped
                          with the script as well.

                    In February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the film rights for Spider-Man, integrating the
                     character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character, and Watts was
                      hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein.
